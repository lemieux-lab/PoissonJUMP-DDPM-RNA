# PoissonJUMP-DDPM-RNA

An implementation of a Poisson-JUMP DDPM inspired by (Chen \& Zhou, 2023) to denoise low-coverage RNA-seq data.
This repository was created for ISMB 2024.

## Usage

If you wish to use this code, it is reccomended to open a Julia REPL in VScode in order to execute the functions and call them.

This code is still very much in developpement and unoptimized, but suggestions are appreciated!
